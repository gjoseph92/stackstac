# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2021-05-05)
Call [`stackstac.show`](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/main/stackstac.show.html) to render DataArrays in interactive ipyleaflet maps in your notebook! See [this example](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/show.html) for more.

- [`mosaic`](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/main/stackstac.mosaic.html) function
- Exposed some assorted [handy geospatial ops](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/main.html#operations)
- More robustly get band metadata (if one Item is missing some asset metadata, just ignore it instead of dropping the whole thing)
- Fixed occasional `ValueError: conflicting sizes for dimension`
- Resolved issue where timestamps became integers
- Support [pystac-client](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client) ItemCollections
- Minimum Python version is now (accurately) 3.8. Stackstac would have failed upon import on 3.7 before.

## 0.1.1 (2021-04-16)
- Passing a `gdal_env` now works when using a distributed cluster (before, you got a pickle error when calling `.compute()`)
