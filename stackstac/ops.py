    Internal function to mosaic a NumPy array along an axis. Does some extra funky stuff to be useful with dask.

    ----------
    arr: array to mosaic, must be at least 1D

    reverse: False = last on top, True = first on top
    nodata: the value to treat as invalid

    Returns

    Flatten a dimension of a `~xarray.DataArray` by picking the first valid pixel.

    The order of mosaicing is from last to first, meaning the last item is on top.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr:
        The `DataArray` to mosaic.
    dim:
        The dimension name to mosaic. Default: None.
    axis:
        The axis number to mosaic. Default: 0. Only one of
        ``dim`` and ``axis`` can be given.
    reverse:
        If False (default), the last item along the dimension is on top.
        If True, the first item in the dimension is on top.
    nodata:
        The value to treat as invalid. Default: NaN.

        To catch common mis-use, raises a ``ValueError`` if ``nodata=nan``
        is used when the array has an integer or boolean dtype. Since NaN
        cannot exist in those arrays, this indicates a different ``nodata``
        value needs to be used.
    split_every:
        For Dask arrays: how many *chunks* to mosaic together at once.

        The Dask default is 4. A higher number will mean a smaller graph,
        but higher peak memory usage.

        Ignored for NumPy arrays.
